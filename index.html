    <p>I got a Tandy in 1991. That computer was a dream. I felt like Terry in Jumpin’ Jack Flash; the blinking white cursor on the black MS-DOS screen sucked me in and refused to let me go. I was so excited that with only a few keystrokes, I could transport myself into a world where gorillas stood on top of buildings and threw atomic bananas at each other. I also started learning Spanish using that computer, but nothing compared to being able to type c:/something just to have the screen flash text back in response.
    <p>
    I was hooked.
    <p>
    Fast-forward to today: I’ve got a notebook filled with more ideas than I have time, a brain that’s overflowing with useless trivia, notes reminding me of inventions that I’ll never actually create, and a pretty spectacular number of hours logged in Skyrim.
    <p>
    I'm livin' large, writing by day, coordinating and marketing events when the sun goes down, and learning to dev like a pro with Grow with Google and Udacity. And it's all good.</p>
